# PHP Project 
## Hackers-Poulette Form
I have to build a form to the name of the company Hackers Poulette. <br> They want to allow their users to contact their support team. My mission is to develop a PHP script displaying a contact form and processing the received answer (sanitize, validate, answer the user).<br>
You can see the form [here](http://hackers-poulettess.herokuapp.com/index.php).

## Motivation behind this?
Exercise as part of my training at [BeCode](https://www.becode.org/) @Brussels training in Web Development. 3 Days to make this, so a dead-line to meet. While doing this project, I had to try to make sense of servers, how PHP works, what is docker, docker-compose and how do you install it, deploy a site with Heroku too. This is my first "back-end" project.

### Form Mockup

### Objectives
#### Improve these
- semantical HTML
- accessibility in HTML
- methodology of progressive enhancement
- PHP programming
- project planning
- mock-up creation
- respect a graphic chart

#### The form needs to contain the following
- name and lastname
- gender
- email address
- country
- subject (3 possibilities + default value of other)
- message

#### Instructions

- the project repository must include a mock-up  :thumbsup:
- the form must have semantical HTML   :thumbsup:
- the HTML must be accessible to the blinds :thumbsup:
- in case of wrong input return the form with a visual error display :thumbsup:
- display the error message near the correct input field   :thumbsup:
- the error message must be readable (helpful to users)   :thumbsup:
- the form has to be sanitised and validated (server side) 
- if an answer validate, respond by email to a given address
- implement anti spam the technique of honeypot :thumbsup:


### Explanation methodology
- design the mock-up of the form how I want the elements to be disposed
- create the HTML structure for semantics
- use of Bootstrap grid system and classes to display elements how the mock-up displayed elements


# Tools used
- HTML,CSS
- Bootstrap
- Figma for the mock-up
- PHP
- Heroku to deploy the form


# Progression
I have added an array for the countries, which did mess up the design, I am working on fixing that
